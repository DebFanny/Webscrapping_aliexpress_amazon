To read the api file you will just need to open a terminal (in the interface go to new then to terminal) in jupyter notebook, install streamlit with:
pip install streamlit
Then you must do:

and finally you upload the python script with streamlit (webscrap_streamlit.py) in jupyter notebook, you go back to the terminal and you do:
streamlit run webscrap_streamlit.py
